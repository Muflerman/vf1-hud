✨ Main Features
👤 Dynamic Player HUD

*   **Intelligent Visibility:** HUD stays hidden during selection screens (multicharacter), spawn menus, and pause menu. Only appears once the player is logged in.
*   **Dynamic Health Bar:** Smart color transition. Green at 100%, smoothly degrading to deep red as health decreases.
*   **Dynamic Armor Bar:** Premium blue-to-white gradient. Only visible if armor > 0.
*   **Hunger & Thirst:** Clean indicators with smooth updates.
*   **Voice indicator:** Integrated voice range feedback.

🚗 Premium Car HUD

*   **Fixed Visibility:** The Car HUD is strictly tied to vehicle state. Only appears when inside a motorized vehicle with the engine running.
*   **Bicycle Exclusion:** The Car HUD automatically stays hidden when riding bicycles (Class 13) for a cleaner, more realistic experience.
*   **High-contrast speedometer:** Crisp and clear speed reading.
*   **Vibration effect:** Immersive shaking effect at high speeds (> 220 KMH).
*   **Segmented RPM bar:** Dynamic and smooth RPM visualizer.
*   **Vertical indicators:** Engine health and Fuel level bars.
*   **Styled headers:** Location, Street, and Gear boxes in amber/brown style.

✨ Interface Cleanliness
*   **Zero-Flicker Native Hiding:** Deep integration to hide default GTA V components (Vehicle Name, Area, Street, etc.) every frame, ensuring they NEVER flash or appear over our premium HUD.
